## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Setup environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate     # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 2. Preprocess & Encode

- Run the preprocessing script to clean and encode features.

- Save the preprocessing pipeline or label encoders (preprocessor.pkl, label_encoders.pkl).

### 3. Train Models

- Use the training.py to train multiple regression models (Linear, Random Forest, LightGBM, etc.).

- Use feature_selection.py to extract top 15 features.

- Compare performance using full features vs top features.

### 4. Hyperparameter Tuning

- Use tuning.py to tune hyperparameters (e.g. for LightGBM) via RandomizedSearchCV or similar.

### 5. Save Artifacts

- After finding the best model, save it as models/best_model.pkl.

- Save preprocessing pipelines / encoders under models/.

### 6. Launch API (FastAPI)

- Navigate into the api/ folder.

- Ensure main.py refers to the correct paths for the model and encoder files.

- Run:
```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload
```
- The API docs will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs.

- You can send a JSON request with your input features to the /predict endpoint.

### 7. Streamlit App
- Navigate into the frontend/ folder.
- Run:
```bash
Streamit run ui.py
```

## 📈 Model Performance (Example)
```bash
Setting	             Model	     RMSE	 MSE	  R²

All     Features	LightGBM	~21.98	~17.11	~0.82
Top 25  Features	LightGBM	~22.75	~16.89	~0.82

```
- These numbers indicate that using top 15 features gives nearly similar performance with fewer features.

## 📝 Notes & Best Practices

- For categorical variables, you can use LabelEncoder or OneHotEncoder — but be consistent between training and inference.

- Avoid including Order_ID or unique identifier columns as features — they do not generalize.

- If using to_csv, always save with index=False to avoid “Unnamed: 0” columns.

- In your API, handle unseen category values gracefully (e.g. default encoding or fallback).

- Remember to drop or convert raw date/time strings into numeric features (hour, day-of-week) to avoid KeyErrors.

## 🛠️ Future Improvements

- Add real-time features like traffic or weather API integration

- Use more advanced models (e.g. ensemble, neural networks)

- Monitor model drift over time

- Deploy to cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP) or containerize (Docker)
